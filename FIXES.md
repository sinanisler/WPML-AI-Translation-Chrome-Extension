# Critical Fixes Applied

## Issues Found and Resolved

### 1. ✅ System Prompt Duplication (FIXED)
**Problem:** System prompt was defined in 3 different places:
- `popup.js` - DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT constant
- `content.js` - hardcoded in variable initialization
- `content.js` - hardcoded in fallback within loadSettings()

**Solution:**
- Created single `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` constant in `content.js`
- System prompt now loads from storage or uses default
- Only ONE source of truth for the default prompt

### 2. ✅ System Prompt Not Being Used (FIXED)
**Problem:** The system prompt was loaded from storage but **NEVER sent to OpenAI API**!

**Solution:**
- Now properly sends system prompt in the `messages` array with role "system"
- User's custom system prompts are now actually used in translations

### 3. ✅ Wrong OpenAI API Endpoint (FIXED)
**Problem:** Using `/v1/responses` which doesn't exist

**Solution:**
- Changed to correct endpoint: `/v1/chat/completions`

### 4. ✅ Wrong API Request Format (FIXED)
**Problem:** Sending `{ model: "...", input: "..." }` which is incorrect

**Solution:**
- Now using correct format with `messages` array:
```javascript
{
  model: selectedModel,
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: systemPrompt },
    { role: "user", content: "Translate..." }
  ],
  temperature: 0.3,
  max_tokens: 4000
}
```

### 5. ✅ Wrong Response Parsing (FIXED)
**Problem:** Trying to parse `data.output[].content[].text` which doesn't exist

**Solution:**
- Now correctly parses: `data.choices[0].message.content`

### 6. ✅ Typo in Default Model (FIXED)
**Problem:** Default fallback was "gpt-5-mini" (doesn't exist)

**Solution:**
- Changed to "gpt-4o" (actual model)

## How It Works Now

1. **Default prompt** is defined once in `content.js` as `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`
2. **User edits** system prompt in popup → saves to `chrome.storage.sync`
3. **Content script** loads custom prompt from storage, or uses default if none exists
4. **OpenAI API call** now properly includes:
   - System prompt (custom or default)
   - User message with translation request
   - Correct endpoint and format
5. **Response parsing** correctly extracts translation from ChatGPT response

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Open extension popup
- [ ] Enter API key
- [ ] Select model (e.g., gpt-4o)
- [ ] Verify system prompt loads (should show default)
- [ ] Edit system prompt if desired
- [ ] Click "Save All Settings"
- [ ] Go to WPML translation page
- [ ] Click "AI Translate" button
- [ ] Verify translation works correctly
- [ ] Check browser console for any errors

## Important Notes

- System prompt is now **actually used** in API calls
- API endpoint is correct: `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`
- Response structure matches OpenAI's Chat Completions API
- Temperature set to 0.3 for consistent translations
- Max tokens set to 4000 for long content
