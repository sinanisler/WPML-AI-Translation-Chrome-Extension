## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Please configure your API key"**
   - Open the extension popup
   - Select your provider (OpenAI or OpenRouter)
   - Enter a valid API key
   - Click "Save All Settings"

2. **"Error loading models"**
   - Verify your API key is correct and active
   - Check that your account has sufficient credits
   - Ensure stable internet connectivity
   - For OpenRouter: Make sure you've added credits to your account

3. **Translation buttons not appearing**
   - Confirm you're on a WPML translation page (`*.ate.wpml.org/dashboard*`)
   - Refresh the page (F5)
   - Wait a few seconds for the page to fully load
   - Check browser console (F12) for any errors

4. **Translation fails or returns errors**
   - **API Credits**: Verify your account has available credits
   - **Rate Limits**: You may be hitting API rate limits
   - **Model Access**: Ensure the selected model is available for your account tier
   - **Network**: Check for firewall or proxy issues blocking API requests

5. **Settings not saving**
   - Make sure to click "Save All Settings" button
   - Check that you've selected a model from the dropdown
   - Verify the system prompt is not empty

6. **Stop button not working**
   - The extension uses immediate abort functionality
   - Current request stops within milliseconds
   - If auto-translate continues, refresh the page

### Debug Information

1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for messages starting with:
   - "Settings loaded:" - Shows loaded configuration
   - "Translation stopped" - Confirms stop action
   - "Error with OpenAI API:" - Shows API errors
4. Check Network tab for failed API requests

### API Key Validation

- **OpenAI keys** start with `sk-` or `sk-proj-`
- **OpenRouter keys** start with `sk-or-v1-`
- Keys are stored securely and encrypted by Chrome
- Each provider stores its key separately
